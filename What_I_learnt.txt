1) bs_theme() can be cleanly defined in a specific file, then called in the theme argument of the main layout function

2) thematic::thematic_shiny() can be used (at least for ggplot2) to style the background/foreground/other colors of a plot based on fg/bg.
	We can even specify a bs_theme() component for a color such as :
		thematic::thematic_shiny(bg = bslib::bs_get_variables(theme = main_theme, varnames = "fg"))

3) More generally, we can retrieve any {bslib} variable with bslib::bs_get_variables() 

4) Buttons work with accent colors defined in their 'class' argument. We can add more than one class, e.g. by adding a size item :
	 shiny::actionButton("secondary_lg", "A button modded", class = "btn-secondary btn-lg")

5) SCSS : target a selector which has two classes in this way :  .class1.class2{...}
	See more here : https://unused-css.com/blog/css-multiple-class-selectors/

6) SCSS : target multiple classes at once with :   .class1, .class2 {...}

7) SCSS : target nested classes (see https://developer.chrome.com/articles/css-nesting/) 

.nesting {
  color: hotpink;

  > .is {
    color: rebeccapurple;

    > .awesome {
      color: deeppink;
    }
  }
}


8) CSS : access highlight values for selectizeInput() with : .selectize-dropdown-content .active {...}
